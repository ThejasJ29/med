                        <p className="blog">Health and Medicines are very sensitive subjects; and when it comes to these, everybody is extra cautious. We trust branded medicines and doctor prescribed medicines without a second thought. On the other hand, generic medicines are often considered to be of low quality only because they come at a lower cost. And despite the very high costs of branded medicines, we prefer them. Is this right? Are we really following the right things? Do we know everything that we should know about generic medicines?</p>
